# Project Road Segmentation

## Git LFS

This project uses Git LFS. Make sure to install it before cloning the repository. See [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).

## Project architecture
The project is organized as follows
```
/checkpoints                # Saved model checkpoints for different architectures
/data                       # Train and test data
/notebooks                  # Past experiments
/src/road_segmentation      # Source code
  /models                   # Models definitions
  /utils                    # Utility functions
  mask_to_submission.py     # Somes functions related to submissions
  submission_to_mask.py     # Somes functions related to submissions
/submissions                # Generated submission files for AIcrowd
infos.md                    # Submissions and checkpoints descriptions
main.ipynb                  # Training code
predict.py                  # Generate predictions on the test set using a trained model. Using Unet by default.
```

## Setting up the environment

First, make sure to clone the repository and to place you on the `main` branch.

### Conda

Dependencies can be managed by conda in the following way. This ensures reproducibility of the environment at the libraries level.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate road-segmentation

# Install pytorch, torchvision, torchaudio, torchinfo

conda install -c conda-forge torchinfo

pip install -e .
```

**Note**: make sure to install pytorch with the right version for your system. You can follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
